first read both files 
file1 
file2

split and keep in array
there will be two arrays

first cut idea 

capture word from file1 first element
then test if present in any of them in second file array

if yes then push it into new array(matched)

now move to second element of array of file1
again capture words \w 
then test if present in any of them in second file array
-----------

second cut idea 
using object

capture only letter and make entries of captured letter and keep value of whole string

do this for both files
it will look like this

file1 = {
  oklw: 79oklw,
  jstc: 381jstc
}

file2 = {
  jstc: jstc331,
  oklw: oklw737
}
